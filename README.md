# COSMO
Self-Monitoring with a Group-based Anomaly Detection Approach.

This is an implementation a group-based anomaly detection method. It allows to autonomously monitor a system (unit) that generates data over time, by comparing it against a group of other similar systems (units). It detects anomalies/deviations in a streaming fashion while accounting for concept drift which is due to external factors that can affect the data.

# Install
You can the package locally (for use on your system), with:
```
$ pip install . -r requirements.txt
```

You can also install the package with a symlink, so that changes to the source files will be immediately available to other users of the package on our system:
```
$ pip install -e . -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage
Please check the examples in the *./examples* directory. Here is a brief explanation:

First, you need to import `GroupDeviation` and create an instance:
```python
from cosmo import GroupDeviation

# Create an instance of GroupDeviation
gdev = GroupDeviation(  nb_units=19,                # Number of units (vehicles)
                        ids_target_units=[0, 1],    # Ids of the (target) units to diagnoise
                        w_ref_group="7days",        # Time window for the reference group
                        w_martingale=15,            # Window size for computing the deviation level
                        non_conformity="median",    # Non-conformity (strangeness) measure: "median" or "knn"
                        k=50,                       # Used if non_conformity is "knn"
                        dev_threshold=.6)           # Threshold on the deviation level
```

An example of data is provided. It contains data from 19 units (consisting of vehicles). Each csv file contains data from one unit (vehicle). To use this example data, you can import the `load_vehicles` function from `cosmo.datasets` as folows:
```python
from cosmo.datasets import load_vehicles

# Streams data from several units (vehicles) over time
dataset = load_vehicles()
nb_units = dataset.get_nb_units() # nb_units = 19 vehicles in this example

# dataset.stream() can then be used as a generator
# to simulate a stream (see example below)

# dataset.stream_unit(uid) can also be used to generate 
# a stream from one unit identified by index (e.g. uid=0)
```

A streaming setting is considered where data (indicated as `x_units` in the example below) is received from the units at each time step `dt`. The method `GroupDeviation.predict(uid, dt, x_units)` is then called each time to diagnoise the test unit indicated by the index `uid` (i.e. the data-point received from this unit at time `dt` is `x_units[uid]`). The `predict` method returns a list of DeviationContext objects. Each DeviationContext object contains the following information:
1. a *strangeness* score : the non-conformity of the test unit to the other units).
2. a *p-value* (in [0, 1]) : the proportion of data from other units which are stranger than the test unit's data.
3. an updated *devaliation* level (in [0, 1]) for the test unit.
4. a boolean *is_dev* indicating if the test unit is significantly deviating from the group.
```python
# At each time dt, x_units contains data from all units.
# Each data-point x_units[i] comes from the i'th unit.

for dt, x_units in dataset.stream():
    
    # diagnoise the selected target units (0 and 1)
    devContextList = gdev.predict(dt, x_units)
    
    for uid, devCon in enumerate(devContextList):
        print("Unit:{}, Time: {} ==> strangeness: {}, p-value: {}, deviation: {} ({})".format(uid, dt, devCon.strangeness, 
        devCon.pvalue, devCon.deviation, "high" if devCon.is_deviating else "low"))

# Plot p-values and deviation levels over time
gdev.plot_deviations()

```
